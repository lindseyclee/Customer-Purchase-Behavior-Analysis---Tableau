# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis (Tableau)

**Course:** MGSC 410 - Applied Business Analytics

## Overview:

This is a hypothetical business proposal for Walmart based on analyzing a [Customer Purchase Behavior dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/logiccraftbyhimanshi/walmart-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset) from Kaggle, including 50,000 customer transactions. Tableau was used to analyze the transactions and create meaningful data visualizations on sales trends, regional sales, discount impacts, and customer segmentation. We used these visualizations and summarized our findings to make informed business recommendations that would boost sales, increase customer retention, and improve marketing strategies. Check out my final presentation for the full analysis!
